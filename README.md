_WARNING: I haven't finished ripping all of the code off of my website yet._

#Lighter Than Air CMS
The blog content management system for elitist asshole developers.
It's dynamic because you don't get enough traffic to warrant static webpages.
It's flat-file because I don't know how to work with databases and you probably don't enjoy it much.

##Key Features:
 * Minimum overhead
 * Blog post metadata
 * Blog posting interface
 * No databases (file operated)

##Things I need to do:
 * Secure posting interface so it can be used online
 * Add category groups
 * Refactor everything
 * Refactor everything again
 * Blog post editing/removal interface
