# The LEGO Essay

*Young Matthew Manno bathes in geometric architecture. Standing less than five feet tall, he gazes upwards into the store's wall of LEGO construction sets.*

*"Matthew, it's time to go."*

*"No, wait! Look at this one. It's got a wizard inside!"*

*No response from mother.*

*"I don't have a wizard, yet."*

Every time I got a new LEGO set, I'd count the people, or minifigures, which were pictorially listed on the box.

*"Your fallacious assumptions will be your end," the Good King says.*

*The Dark Wizard replies, "And you will submit to my ideologies or die!"*

LEGO built a brand on the art of destruction, but likewise creation, capitalizing on what could be made new out of the ruins of old. Like the people, the buildings could be torn up, broken down, and brought back to life. This was my first introduction to character arcs and good writing.

George Orwell would have liked LEGO. His essay, Politics and the English Language, called for sentences to be constructed with clear and concise phrasing. The perfect sentence, story, and LEGO house all fashion elegant simplicity. A love story was never told by castigating religion. Likewise, a house was never built by using parts for a television set.

This is the way children view the world. Life would be perfect if countries, families, and gods were built with LEGO. Orwell criticized platitudes like "fascism", and in life humans settle for meaningless marriage and divorce. Politicians and priests lack vision because their ideologies are constructed without foundations.

When I first fell for a girl and first fought with my parents, I lost the Good King and Dark Wizard to a world of gray. Fear and self-loathing obfuscated an otherwise flawless design.

*"Matthew, calm down! Your father loves you," my mother assures me.*

*"No! He doesn't love anybody!"*

*"Then we need to start by loving him."*

The flawed nature of man left me in a pool of misshapen resin; I traded in my LEGO muck for a Canon camera and began to assign meaning to a chaotic world through film.

**...**

**THREE YEARS LATER**

*Hushed whispers rise and fade.*

*The stillness of sleep resigns to images of my education, my childhood, set adrift in a stream of consciousness, irretrievable by the sailor lest he be seized by the muses. With a pinch of the camera's closing shutter I awaken in the food court of a mall, as though I had drifted off waiting for something.*

*Crowds fall away as blood flows into my head, returning the world to focus; the camera bag taxes my shoulder and I happen upon a familiar place.*

The longer humanity wades in pools of gray, the more it flirts with the notion that nothing is real at all. Internet videos tell me that I live in the Matrix, and people tell me that I am in a coma. Infinitism forgets humans and characters, love and hate. These are foundations for stories as well as philosophies.

*"Sir, can I help you find anything?"*

*"No, thank you. I'm just browsing."*

But humanity is not an axiom. Unlike math and science, she is imperfect, subject to anger and guilt, depression and mourning.

What, then, is passion when there are no right answers? What is morality when all is gray?  Leaders, writers, and scholars all must have vision. While objective truth may not exist in every circumstance, we must keep searching, lest we slam the door on what could be the greatest step forward in human history.

Nostalgia aside, LEGO reminds me of my admiration for storytelling, a place where dialogue continues this noble search for truth. Although we all grow up, adults recognize the importance of retrospect. I didn't buy anything at the LEGO store, not this fateful day. *I'd built them all already.*
